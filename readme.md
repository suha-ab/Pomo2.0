### Project Description
Pomo is a time management bot based on The Pomodoro Technique (developed by [Francesco Cirillo](https://francescocirillo.com/) in the 1980s). The Pomodoro Technique is a time managment method that uses a timer to break work into intervals of, typically, 25 minutes. These intervals are separated by short breaks, typically 5 minutes.

Pomo was coded and developed using discordJS.

### How to Use
To view Pomo's commands, simply type "!pomo help". The main Pomo command is "!pomo start" which begins 1 default pomodoro (four 25-minute intervals, 5-minute short breaks, and 15-minute long breaks).

### Project Challenges and Lessons

Challenges:
1. Pomo is a project I started in the summer of 2021 and continued to work on every summer. During the summer of 2021, I had little to no Javascript knowledge and struggled significantly to work on the project. I abandoned the project but returned to it the next summer. Fortunately, I had gained much more Javascript knowledge at that point and was able to create a functioning bot. My goal this summer was to refine my code through static and dynamic code analysis. Unfortunately, I had lost all my previous code due to a data reset. I plan to fully code the bot again and to create an even more refined and improved version of Pomo.


Lessons:
1. Developed Pomo using Agile development processes.
2. Used Linters for static code analysis.
