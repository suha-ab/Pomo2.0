### Project Description
Pomo is a time management bot based on The Pomodoro Technique (developed by [Francesco Cirillo](https://francescocirillo.com/) in the 1980s). The Pomodoro Technique is a time managment method that uses a timer to break work into intervals of, typically, 25 minutes. These intervals are separated by short breaks, typically 5 minutes.

Pomo was coded and developed using discordJS.

### How to Use
To view Pomo's commands, simply type "!pomo help". The main Pomo command is "!pomo start" which begins 1 default pomodoro (four 25-minute intervals, 5-minute short breaks, and 15-minute long breaks).
